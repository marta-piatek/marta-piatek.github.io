            <p class = "section-content">From Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML): Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>

            <p class = "section-content">From Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS): CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting. </p>

            <p class = "section-content">From Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript): JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[7] JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[8] JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior,[9] and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it. </p>

            <p class = "section-content">From Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udacity): In June 2014, Udacity and ATT announced the "Nanodegree" program, designed to teach programming skills needed to qualify for an entry-level IT position at ATT. The coursework is said to take less than a year to complete, and cost. It said it will offer paid internships to some graduates of the program.[39][40]“We can’t turn you into a Nobel laureate,” Mr. Thrun said to a learner. “But what we can do is something like upskilling — you’re a smart person, but the skills you have are inadequate for the current job market, or don’t let you get the job you aspire to have. We can help you get those skills.”[41] A cybersecurity nanodegree was announced at the RSA Conference in April 2018.[42]</p>
